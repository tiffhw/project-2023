# Abstract

Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020). It is a chronic(long-lasting) metabolic disorder that affects the bodyâ€™s ability to store and use glucose (sugar). For people with diabetes, their bodies either cannot produce sufficient insulin or cannot apply it properly, and this results in high blood glucose levels. Diabetes will affect the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes, and nerves over time. There are three types of diabetes and the most common is type 2. Type 2 diabetes means that the body cannot use insulin well and cannot keep the blood sugar at normal levels. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented if we maintain a healthy lifestyle, such as eating healthy, exercising, and keeping fit. Type 1 diabetes is more genetic that develops in childhood or adolescence and results in the destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. And the third type of diabetes is gestational. 
In this project, the goal is to predict if we can accurately predict a patient who has diabetes. And find whether there are significant factors to predict diabetes. We will conduct a series of modeling on these parameters to identify which parameters are highly correlated.

# Dataset

The data used for this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset. The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This dataset contains 768 observations that were women who were at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage, and living near Phoenix, Arizona.
